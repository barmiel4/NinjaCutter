*debugging system for the whole engine, comprised of:
	*some GUI overlay/window displaying information about all shapes and their physics properties i.e. current forces, mass, moment of inertia etc
	*graphical way of showing what is going on with the shapes(collision, forces direction etc.)
*examine cutting/slicing physics in more detail(how to apply forces etc.)
*add different materials
*calculate weigth based on the material and dimensions
*add correct moment of inertia calculation for each shape
*add collision
*calculating centres works weird(espacially on circles)
*limit refersh time(30hz / 60hz)
*possibility to stop the simulation at any given time

-----------------------------------------------------------
*excact list of features of the GUI overlay:
	*(probably implement with IMGUI)
	*window with information about currently selected / all objects
	*linear velocity
	*angular velocity
	*position
	*force applied(direction & strength)
	*torque
	*moment of interia
	*mass
	*(maybe) lifetime story -> display the history of forces applied to the rigid body(what changed) 
		and what were the body information in some period of time(i.e. force at second 0 of movement, force at second 1 of movement etc.))
	*what more??
-----------------------------------------------------------
*exact list of features of the graphisc complement
	*display collision boundries(only simplified i.e. just a rectangle centred at the origin of the body)
	*display the centres of the bodies
	*(maybe) display the vectors(foreces, velocities etc.) as arrows or sth like that
	*(huge system) display the physics history as a visual timeline(i.e. you see a "shadow" of the shape as a previous movement key frames and you can display a info about any of them, as a GUI overlay), also the ability to scroll the timeline
